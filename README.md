## Quick Hide Previous Layer then make new layer
A script for making new layers and hiding previously selected layer quicker for Krita. I use this to practice gesture drawings.

### How to use
1. Go to Tools > Scripts > Ten Scripts
2. Click on ... button
3. Select the hide-prev-layer-new-layer file
4. Click Ok

In order to change the binding to a different key, you need to go to:
1. Click on Settings > Configure Krita...
2. Go to Keyboard Shortcuts
3. Locate Ten scripts and change the Execute Script (the number you selected the script file) to the keybind you want.
